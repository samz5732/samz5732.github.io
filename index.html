As an intern, with not a lot of Nationwide experience, he had left (through not fault of his own) and requirements document that was insufficient. As someone who started in operations with a technology background, I was able to create a requirements document that diverted Lotsofbots away from IADT and towards pallm for Simple Disbursement processing. I also identified each decision point that the processor makes, where to retrieve the data, and how that would need to be incorporated in code as a validation check. I even gave specific coordinates on the screen that they would need to enter each data point, fields where error messages will display and the sql they will need to run to pull policy information. In the design phase, I took this a step further and processed mock policies in Beta Views/Pallm in the given scenario that needed UAT testing. Lastly, I rebuilt the, at the time, word template to incorporate all the rules and nigo validations using visual basis for applications and worked with the Views DBA to upload and maintain it. This template became the foundation for the current Salesforce template which I was a Saleforce UAT for.</th>

    <h2>Sr, Beneficiary Claims Anayst</h2>
    <h4><b>Job Summary</b></h4> 
    <p>As a Financial Services Representative within the Annuity Beneficiary Claims team, the primary goal is to collaborate with beneficiaries and brokers to determine the most optimal approach for initiating an annuity claim. Beneficiaries can take various forms, including individuals (such as children or spouses), trusts, organizations, or estates, each with distinct claim options and document requirements. A crucial skill for a representative in the beneficiary claims team is the ability to recognize all factors that can influence the available choices for beneficiaries. These factors encompass considerations like whether the contract is Qualified or Non-Qualified, the initiation of required minimum distributions, the beneficiary's relationship to the deceased individual, and whether the deceased person served as the contract owner, annuitant, or both. Additionally, the contract's value and the beneficiary's residency status in the United States play essential roles.<br><br>This role demands that representatives possess expertise that extends beyond their specific field, as they work with beneficiaries who have recently experienced a loss. Given the sensitivity of this process, each representative must adeptly handle potential issues that may fall outside their immediate responsibilities. These issues may pertain to matters such as riders, commissions, New Business Products, Withdrawals, Transfers, and a comprehensive understanding of the distinct rules and regulations governing each state and their impact on the claims process. Providing exceptional customer service as a death benefits representative necessitates engagement with various teams within the annuity department to ensure a seamless and supportive experience for beneficiaries.</p>

Knowing this, I decided to keep track of the numbers of notifications received on a daily basis, as well as returning daily requests from follow up to identify if there were any trends. It was very evident that there were certain days of year, days of the month and even days or times of the week where we would be overloaded and unable to recover. Using this data, and several statisical calculations, it was determined that we would need to add more members to the team, as well as switch the team from the two roles at the time (NIGO Rep and Processor) to one role that would do both to reduce hand offs. </th>

    <h2>Tax Specialist</h2>
    <h4><b>Job Summary</b></h4> 
    <p>In my role as a tax specialist, my primary duty involved the maintenance of the TaxApp schema within the PMTS02g database. This schema serves as the repository for all tax form information intended for distribution to our annuity customers. The data stored within this schema undergoes validation and is generated in Pallm on a monthly basis. Subsequently, it is transmitted to the database as a batch file. This batch file represents a consolidated summary of transactional data sourced from Pallm, using criteria such as Policy Number, Individual Identification Number, resident State, withdrawal reason code, and group code. This consolidation process condenses several million transactional records into approximately 200,000 form entries. However, it's important to note that this process is not flawless and is susceptible to errors. <br><br>My responsibilities encompassed taking this condensed cumulative data and reconciling it with both the PMTS database (Transactional/Non-cumulative) and the Explain Database (Transactional/Non-cumulative) using various technological tools. Furthermore, I was responsible for incorporating known system defects into the monthly reports I generated. Additionally, I provided information and guidance to multiple teams within the operations, service center, and resolution departments.<br><br>One of my significant achievements in this role was successfully identifying and resolving a discrepancy in Federal and State withholding amounts, a matter that had garnered the attention of senior management and directors. This discrepancy amounted to an annual imbalance of approximately $500,000.</p>

    <th>Annuity Death Benefit Process</th>
    <th>Pallm is known for various defects which creates many manual processes accross operations. One of the biggest, and most annoying, manual process was one that Matthew Septer was in charge of for several years: Death Benefit Research. When a claim is processed, pallm had incorrectly calculated the cost basis, taxable amounts and federal and state withholding for each beneficiary. This required Matt to have to research each beneficiary claim (a policy could have been looked at multiple times depending on how many beneficiaries there were) to add up all deposits and withdrawals since the policies inception to calculate the correct cost basis. If the beneficiary was processed from the payee tab, then the demographic information on the tax form would be the decedent. <br><br> <b>Solution:</b> I determined that we could use the native IBM API to enter the policy information into pallm, retrieve all deposit and withdrawal information to automatically calculate cost basis, and determine if the demographic information was correct. This report was a daily report that was a full time job to do and the code reduced that time to 10 miutes. Later, I realized I could enhance the solution further using vba to loop through the policy, generating a sql statement for each policy as it does so, to automatically calculate basis as well as pull in all the demographic information.(</th>

    <th>Death Benefit Tool</th>
    <th>Many issues are caused by system defects that require manual review, however, human error is equally as bad. In the tax team, your job is to find and fix any issues regardless of the cause. For the longest time, the team was in a "fix the error, not the root cause" stage. Beneficiary claims was a high turnover position at this point which cause many user errors. As someone who came from claims, I was familiar with all of the variables and decision points a representative would have to consider when discussing options with clients and processing claims. As a tax representative, I now saw this process from a new perspective further down the line, so I created a decision matrix for beneficiary claims that would request the policy number from the representative. It would then pull all the necessary policy information to identify options available, as well as crucial information for the beneficiary that could be overlooked.</th>

    <th>Federal and State Withholding Reconciliation</th>
    <th>Back in 2013, the enterprise as a whole used PMTS to remit federal and state withholding to the IRS on a daily basis. The only exception to this was the Annuity department. Annuities remitted Federal and State taxes through Explain. A project was completed in 2015 to switch Annuity remittance to PMTS to align with the rest of the enterprise. The issue is that annuity tax forms, unlike the rest of the company, are not generated in PMTS but are generated from Pallm and sent to TaxApp. Pallm also generates Explain data so there was never any discrepency between remittence and reporting. After we started using PMTS, we had an annual out of balance in the hundreds of thousands that couldn't be identified. We only knew of this error after the year end when FinOps balanced the books. <br><br><b>Solution:</b> I developed a tool that would pull the monthly generated tax form from the TaxApp database, the daily transaction data from the Explain database, and the daily transactional data from the PMTS database to automatically compare values on the following fields: Policy Number, WRC, FIT, SIT, and State. <br><br> This resulted in a monthly report that correctly identified, on average, the 200 to 300 policies out of balance that needed to be manually corrected before year end. </th>
